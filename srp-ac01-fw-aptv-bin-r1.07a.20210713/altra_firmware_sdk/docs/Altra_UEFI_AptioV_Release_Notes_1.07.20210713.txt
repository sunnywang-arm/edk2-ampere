    Hotplug Hardware and Kernel Requirement:
    - Mt Jade EVT system: EVT2: B48.03029.00SC
                          DVT: B48.03028.00SC
    - SSD Samsung's 983 DCT or Intel SSD DC P4510 SERIES
    - Back plane model: Mt Jade 2U 2.5" NVME BP 19X89 SB B48.03029.00SB
    - Back plane FW: D03
    - Ampere CentOS: AMP CentOS 8.0-20201201 or later
	- Limitation:
		- Support only one disk removal/insertion at a time
		- Remove and insertion requires at least 3 seconds delay
		
    Notes:
    - Due to change in in-band FW interface, the FW image for
	  in-band and external SPI programmer are now the same 
	  file. The UEFI fwu tool is also updated.

    Known Issues:
    - Bug XXXXX: AMI SCE not supported
      Solution: Ampere reference design does not enable support for
                SCE due to security concern. Other platform may
                choose to enable this capability but will depend on
                their security solution/risk assessment.
    - Bug XXXXX: ATF/UEFI FW 1.07 does not work with SCP FW 1.06.
      Solution: Update to matching FW version.
    - Bug 76316: Linux hibernation does not work.
      Solution: This is no solution at this time.
    - Bug 80031: Kernel crash dump fails due to limited 32-bit RAM
      Solution A: Limit the crash dump RAM to size lesser than 490MB.
                  Though, you may have issue with PCIe 32-bit cards.
      Solution B: Enable slave socket 1GB RAM from UEFI.
                  With subNUMA hemisphere/Quadrant, not all Linux
                  distribution will work.
    - Bug 82768: NVDIMM-N DAX/DSM does not work
      Solution: NVDIMM-N DAX/DSM require kernel version 5.11 or above.
    - Bug 78681: Rarely, Mellanox CX4 linked up at Gen1 instead Gen3.
      Solution: If you observed this, reboot the system.
	- Bug 89615: 2P link UE crash dump does not include data content dump
	  Solution: On 2P link UE error, the crash dump includes only an indication
	            that the error occurred. The current implementation does not
				provide any additional data.

    Hotplug Hardware and Kernel Requirement:
    - Mt Jade EVT system: EVT2: B48.03029.00SC 
                          DVT: B48.03028.00SC	
    - SSD Samsung's 983 DCT or Intel SSD DC P4510 SERIES

    - Back plane FW: D03
    - Ampere CentOS: AMP CentOS 8.0-20201201 or later	

	IMPORTANT NOTE:
	In 1.03, the SPI-NOR layout was changed. The new layout is defined
	in the Altra Interface Firmware Requirement specification. Though
	in 1.03, the RAW ATF/UEFI firmware image was padded with 4MB of 
	0xFF to erase all FW setting in the new location. As such, 1.03 
	does not preserve any setting when update from 1.02. But in 1.04,
	compatibility was maintaied to some extend in term of setting.
	As such, there is NO 4MB padded of 0xFF. This change can break
	external flash programmer or BMC. Therefore, when update
	to this version (1.04) with Mt Jade reference design, first update 
	BMC to corresponding FW version of this release. Then, update 
	Altra SoC firmware. In addition, all setting such as board setting
	and etc are now using the new SPI-NOR layout. And this newer BMC
	in Mt Jade design is NOT compatible with FW version 1.03 or below.
	Therefore, use BMC from 1.04 with FW from 1.04 or above. Use BMC 
	from 1.03 with firmware from 1.03 or below. For more information
	regarding BMC compatibility, see BMC release note of Mt Jade.
	
	Known Issues:
	- Bug XXXXX: AMI SCE not supported
	  Solution: Ampere reference design does not enable support for
				SCE due to security concern. Other platform may
				choose to enable this capability but will depend on
				their security solution/risk assessment.

	  Solution: This is no solution at this time.
	- Bug 80031: Kernel crash dump fails due to limited 32-bit RAM
	  Solution A: Limit the crash dump RAM to size lesser than 490MB.
	              Though, you may have issue with PCIe 32-bit cards.
	  Solution B: Enable slave socket 1GB RAM from UEFI. 
	              With subNUMA hemisphere/Quadrant, not all Linux 
				  distribution will work.
	- Bug 82768: NVDIMM-N DAX/DSM does not work

	- Bug 79448: System failed to boot with 'ERROR: Exit boot services failed'
	  Solution: Manual select the kernel to boot or configure

	            from showing up after failed boot.
	- Bug 78681: Rarely, Mellanox CX4 linked up at Gen1 instead Gen3.
	  Solution: If you observed this, reboot the system.
	- Bug 82959: NMI interrupt changed which breaks compatibility with 1.03
	            based Altra SoC
	  Solution: Due to recent switch from GPIO i2c register trigger, the
	            NMI interrupt number changed. Please make note and update
				your NMI interrupt number accordingly.
    - Bug 82314: On NVMe hotplug with mulitple disk concurrently,
                 Linux kernel reports soft lockup.
      Solution: This is under investigation. Remove and insert
                one NVMe at a time.

                          DVT: B48.03028.00SC

	IMPORTANT NOTE:
	In 1.03, the SPI-NOR layout was changed. The new layout is defined
	in the Altra Interface Firmware Requirement specification. Though
	in 1.03, the RAW ATF/UEFI firmware image was padded with 4MB of 
	0xFF to erase all FW setting in the new location. As such, 1.03 
	does not preserve any setting when update from 1.02. But in 1.04,
	compatibility was maintaied to some extend in term of setting.
	As such, there is NO 4MB padded of 0xFF. This change can break
	external flash programmer or BMC. Therefore, when update
	to this version (1.04) with Mt Jade reference design, first update 
	BMC to corresponding FW version of this release. Then, update 
	Altra SoC firmware. In addition, all setting such as board setting
	and etc are now using the new SPI-NOR layout. And this newer BMC
	in Mt Jade design is NOT compatible with FW version 1.03 or below.
	Therefore, use BMC from 1.04 with FW from 1.04 or above. Use BMC 
	from 1.03 with firmware from 1.03 or below. For more information
	regarding BMC compatibility, see BMC release note of Mt Jade.
	
	Known Issues:
	- Bug XXXXX: AMI SCE not supported
	  Solution: Ampere reference design does not enable support for
				SCE due to security concern. Other platform may
				choose to enable this capability but will depend on
				their security solution/risk assessment.
	- Bug XXXXX: ATF/UEFI FW 1.04 does not work with SCP FW 1.03.
	  Solution: Update to matching FW version.
	- Bug 76316: Linux hibernation does not work.
	  Solution: This is no solution at this time.
	- Bug 80031: Kernel crash dump fails due to limited 32-bit RAM
	  Solution A: Limit the crash dump RAM to size lesser than 490MB.
	              Though, you may have issue with PCIe 32-bit cards.
	  Solution B: Enable slave socket 1GB RAM from UEFI. 
	              With subNUMA hemisphere/Quadrant, not all Linux 
				  distribution will work.
	- Bug 82768: NVDIMM-N DAX/DSM does not work
	  Solution: NVDIMM-N DAX/DSM require kernel version 5.11 or above.
	- Bug 79448: System failed to boot with 'ERROR: Exit boot services failed'

	            from showing up after failed boot.
	- Bug 78681: Rarely, Mellanox CX4 linked up at Gen1 instead Gen3.
	  Solution: If you observed this, reboot the system.
	- Bug 82206: U.2 NVMe re-insertion does not detect in some case
	  Solution: There is no solution at this time.
	- Bug 83228: System panic when doing multiple disk removal/insertion
	  Solution: Perform removal/insertion one disk at a time.
	- Bug 82959: NMI interrupt changed which breaks compatibility with 1.03
	            based Altra SoC
	  Solution: Due to recent switch from GPIO i2c register trigger, the
	            NMI interrupt number changed. Please make note and update
				your NMI interrupt number accordingly.

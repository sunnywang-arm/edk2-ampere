License Content
All of my works you find here are freeware. You may freely copy, use, quote,
modify or redistribute them as long as you properly attribute my contribution
and have given a quick thought about whether Roman might perhaps be
interested
to read what you did with his stuff. Horizontal rules don't apply.
All additions that have been added since I started maintaining Unifong
have been added by me (who has placed all his additions in the public
domain) or by someone sending them in without an attached license (and
hence implicitly being included in the above license.) Any new glyphs
taken from preexisting fonts will be taken only from those under
X11-like licenses that add no further restrictions.

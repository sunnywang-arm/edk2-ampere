# Software Release Package (SRP) Release Notes

## 2020.07.04

* Version upgrades across:
  - Ampere CentOS
  - Ampere Debug Tools
  - Ampere BMC Software Development Kit (MegaRAC & OpenBMC)
  - Ampere Firmware Software Development Kit (AptioV)

* Removal of Ampere GCC distribution via the SRP process. All compiler updates can be
  found on developer.amperecomputing.com.

* Addition of /info/ folder to be included with all SRP packages. This folder will
  include all system level notes, guides, and license information.

* SRP packaging process moved from mono-package structure to multi-package structure.
  All content in prior SRP releases was contained in one single package, packaged by
  license and contract limitations. To address concerns with size, navigability, and
  ease of version reference we've moved to a component-based packaging model. SRPs will
  now be broken into packages based on component, provider, and content scope. 

  Possible component types and providers:
    * Firmware (fw)
      - AptioV (aptv)
      - EDK2 (edk2)
    * Management (mgmt)
      - MegaRAC (mgr)
      - OpenBMC (obmc)
    * Debug Tools (debugtools)
      - Ampere Distributed (amp)
    * Operating Systems (os)
      - Ampere Distributed (amp)

  Possible scopes:
    * Binary Content (bin)
    * Source Content (src)
    * Documentation Content (doc)
    * Developer Targeted Documentation Content (devdoc)
    * User Targeted Documentation Content (userdoc)

  This is then consolidated into an SRP naming convention, here are some examples:
    * srp-ac01-fw-aptv-src-r2020.07.04
    * srp-ac01-mgmt-mgr-src-r2020.07.04
    * srp-ac01-debugtools-amp-src-r2020.07.04
    * etc.

  Note on versions: the version field is composed of a date in YYYY.MM.DD. In the case
  where multiple distinct releases are made in a single day, the alphabet is used to 
  further clarify. Where the first release is 2020.07.04, subsequent releases might 
  be 2020.07.04a, 2020.07.04b, etc.
